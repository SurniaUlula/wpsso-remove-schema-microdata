WPSSO extension to remove outdated template Schema Microdata and leave Schema JSON-LD markup untouched for Google and Bing.

== Description ==

<p><strong>Does your theme include outdated, innacurate, or incomplete Schema Microdata?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you prefer using the latest (and much better) Schema JSON-LD markup standard?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Would you like to remove Schema Microdata markup added by other plugins to your content?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are you using <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/">the WPSSO JSON extension</a> (recommended), and would like to <em>cleanup</em> the Schema Microdata from your theme?</strong></p>

<p>The WPSSO Remove Schema Microdata (WPSSO RSM) extension removes unwanted Schema Microdata markup from the webpage body, leaving Schema JSON-LD markup and Schema meta tags in the head section untouched. WPSSO RSM filters the webpage content dynamically, allowing you to activate/deactivate the plugin to enable/disable the removal of Schema Microdata.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong> &mdash; WPSSO Remove Schema Microdata (WPSSO RSM) is an extension for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO)</a> plugin, which <em>automatically</em> creates complete and accurate meta tags and Schema markup for Social Sharing Optimization (SSO) and SEO.</p>
